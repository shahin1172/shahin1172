Hi, I'm Shahin ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§  I specialize in backend development with Django and Python, focusing on building robust, scalable applications with clean logic and real-world data flow.
- ðŸ§© I'm drawn to backend work because it brings together structured problem-solving, performance, and security â€” I enjoy using Django, PostgreSQL, and RESTful APIs to make ideas come to life.
- ðŸ§± I care about building projects that are easy to understand, maintain, and improve â€” with modular structure, meaningful commits, and solid documentation throughout.
- ðŸŽ¯ I aim to contribute to serious backend projects where architecture, quality, and long-term thinking matter â€” especially within remote teams that value ownership, clear communication, and continuous improvement.
